===============

*Roads of the Ocean* Visualization project.

Hi, right now this repository is just a stub, but its eventual goal is to be the resting place of code and analysis related to the [Roads of the Ocean ](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/7555-roads-of-the-ocean) crowdfunded science project. This repository will contain any code used to make the models, and will cross reference materials posted at [http://oceanroads.us](http://oceanroads.us).

Update, 2012.05.25
------------------

This project was fully funded! Work will begin in late June on project.
